Quick overview:

apply MVC strategy and OO JS on NodeJS level. 
Aiming to normalise:
 
* clearly split MVC and provide the comunication flow direction controller -> model -> view
* minimise libraries declaration then loading models
* self test schema generator 
* self performance diagnostic and visualisation for bottle neck based on socket timing 
* DRY: decalre once and the find the rest depencies 
* Rich caching engine using the RAM memory under the patterns: Press, Events, Blind 

The project designed to cary multiple split projects under the same micro-controller with option to cascade the controllers but sync and use the same libraries

In node world it is important to know supporting node versions used to develop the framework:
'''
node -v # v10.2.1
npm -v  # 5.6.0
uname -a # 4.13.0-43-generic #48~16.04.1-Ubuntu
